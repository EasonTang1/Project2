			<h2>Computer Units</h2>
				<p>conversion goes as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>1024 kilobyte (KB) = 1 megabyte (MB)</li>
					<li>1024 MB = 1 Gigabyte (GB)</li>
					<li>1024 GB = 1 Terabyte (TB)</li>
				</ol>
			<h2>Computer Components</h2>
				<a name="input"></a>
				<h3>Input Devices</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The input device is anything physical (sometimes digital) that will stimulate a power current into a computer. Common examples are the keyboard, the mouse or the on/ off button on the computer.</li>
					</ul>
				<a name="logic"></a>
				<h3>Logic Gates</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Logic gates are the foundation of the key PC component, and consists gates such as AND, OR, XOR or NOT. These gates get formed to build larger gates, and then build on top of that and eventually into the CPU.</li>
					</ul>
				<a name="CPU"></a>
				<h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>2 components inside the CPU</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Control Unit (CU)</li>
									<ul>
										<li>It performs the task of excecuting commands and directs all operations.</li>
									</ul>
								<li>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</li>
									<ul>
										<li>This component carries out calculations done by the computer.</li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
						<li>The CPU itself is the main processor of the computer, and includes the 2 components listed above.</li>
					</ul>
				<a name="memory"></a>
				<h3>Memory</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>2 Types of Memory</li>
							<ul>
								<a name="internal"></a>
								<li>Internal Memory</li>
									<ul>
										<li>2 types of internal memory</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Random Access Memory (RAM)</li>
													<ul>
														<li>The Random Access Memory is extremely fast at performing what memory is for; reading or writing. The downside for RAM is that it can only be used for a short period of time, because it needs to be powered; once the power is off, the RAM sticks forget everything.</li>
													</ul>
												<li>Read- Only Memory (ROM)</li>
													<ul>
														<li>The Read- Only Memory is snugly fit into a PC component, and stores the firmware, only the key components. The ROM is very difficult to remove or change.</li>
													</ul>
											</ul>
									</ul>
								<a name="external"></a>
								<li>External Memory</li>
									<ul>
										<li>2 Types of External Memory</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Internal Storage</li>
													<ul>
														<li>The Internal Storage stores information for long periods of time and can retain the information without power, which the RAM cannot do. The speed for the storage drives is painfully slow, while the RAM is all about speed. Key difference between the Internal Storage and the External Storage is that the Internal Storage is plugged in to the computer inside the PC casing, while the External is plugged from the outside via a USB cord.</li>
													</ul>
												<li>External Storage</li>
													<ul>
														<li>The External Storage is the same as the Internal Storage except it's stored on the outside. External performance is slower than Internal, because it was never made for gaming; their purpose is for storing/ archiving.</li>
													</ul>
											</ul>
										<li>3 Types of External Memory</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Optical Memory</li>
													<ul>
														<li>The Optical Memory is a type of storage which uses lasers to read. write data. Common examples are Compact Disks (CDs) or Digital Versatile Disks (DVDs).</li>
													</ul>
												<li>Magnetic Memory</li>
													<ul>
														<li>Once the most advanced component of the computer memory, it is now outclassed by the newer and faster flash memory. The Magnetic Memory includes devices such as Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) or floppy disks, which uses magnets to store and an extremely rapid-moving needle to read the stored information. One aspect of HDDs which outclass the SSDs is its lifespan; due to the SSD's intricate architecture makes its lifespan limited. The HDD can retain information potentially for decades, if it's minimally used.</li>
													</ul>
												<li>Flash Memory</li>
													<ul>
														<li>The common storage device, this type of memory is incredibly fast due to its use of quantum physics (quantum tunneling), and includes devices such has memory sticks, Solid State Drives (SSDs) or USB drives.</li>
													</ul>
											</ul>
									</ul>
							</ul>
					</ul>
				<a name="output"></a>
				<h3>Output Devices</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The Output Devices is anything that acts as the output to the excecuted command set by the Internal Device, and processed by the CPU, GPU or other computer components.</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>other computer components</h3>
